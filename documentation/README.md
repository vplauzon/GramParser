# Parser as a Service - Online Documentation

Parser as a Service (PAS) is a grammar-based parser running as a REST service.  It allows you to implement Domain Specific Languages (DSLs).

A [Quickstart is available here](../README.md).

## PAS grammar primitives

Here are the primitives in PAS grammar:

* [Literal](primitives/literal.md)
* [Range](primitives/range.md)
* [Any](primitives/any.md)
* [Repeat](primitives/repeat.md)
* [Disjunction](primitives/disjunction.md)
* [Sequence](primitives/sequence.md)
* [Substract](primitives/substract.md)

### Grammar Concepts

Here are grammar concepts transversals to different rules:

* [Interleaves](interleave.md)
* [Referencing rules](referencing.md)
* [Children details](children.md)
