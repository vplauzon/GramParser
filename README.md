# Parser as a Service

Parser as a Service:  a grammar-based parser running as a REST service.

A workbench is [available online](https://pasworkbench.azurewebsites.net/).

Parser as a Service is based on the defunct project 'M' from Microsoft, circa 2008.  The workbench takes inspiration from the three column M editor, which was a Windows-based application.

[Documentation is available here](Documentation/README.md).  For now, let's do a quick start.
